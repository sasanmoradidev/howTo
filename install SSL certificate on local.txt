1. install chocolaty
add this script ot powershell:

Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol -bor 3072; iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://community.chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))

2. check is chocolaty installed:

choco /?

3. install mkcert:

choco install mkcert

4. Setup mkcert on your machine (creates a CA)

mkcert -install

5. After running the above commands, you'll have created a certificate authority on your machine which enables you to generate certificates for all of your future projects.

From the root of your create-react-app project, you should now run:

# Create .cert directory if it doesn't exist
mkdir -p .cert

# Generate the certificate (ran from the root of this project)
mkcert -key-file ./.cert/key.pem -cert-file ./.cert/cert.pem "localhost"


We'll be storing our generated certificates in the .cert directory. These should not be committed to version control, so you should update your .gitignore to include the .cert directory.

6. Next, we need to update the start script again to include our newly created certificate

   "scripts": {
    "start": "set HTTPS=true&&set SSL_CRT_FILE=./.cert/cert.pem&&set SSL_KEY_FILE=./.cert/key.pem&&react-scripts start",
    "build": "react-scripts build",
    "test": "react-scripts test",
    "eject": "react-scripts eject"
  },

7. This procedure just works in Chrome

8. to install the certificate in android go to this address \AppData\Local\mkcert and copy the cert in android storage.
then go to this address: settings -> Security -> Advanced -> Encryption & credentials -> install a certificate
